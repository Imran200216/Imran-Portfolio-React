        "At Safatech, I deployed the KARS App across multiple platforms including TestFlight, Shorebird, Play Store, and App Store, ensuring smooth delivery and release management. I also contributed to the KARS Admin Panel (built with Flutter) by fixing issues and implementing corrections for better stability and performance. Additionally, I integrated a printer management system into Restapos, a Flutter-based POS solution for Windows and Android, enabling seamless support for Sunmi printers and enhancing the appâ€™s retail functionality. I also implemented GraphQL to optimize data fetching, improve API efficiency, and ensure smooth communication between the client and server.",

        "At Yuvabe, I worked on a Doctor Notes App for a Singapore-based project. The app integrates REST APIs built with FastAPI and uses Postgres as the database along with Firebase Authentication for secure user management. I implemented BLoC for state management, GoRouter for navigation, and GetIt for dependency injection, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and scalable Flutter architecture. This project strengthened my experience in building production-ready apps with robust backend integration and modern Flutter design patterns.",

I integrated Google ML Kit using the Dart package google_entity_extraction_kit to handle the entity extraction process, ensuring accurate and efficient data parsing. The extracted information was then stored securely in Firestore, providing a smooth and intelligent way to digitize and manage visiting card data.",
